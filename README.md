# Audio deepfake fraud detection 🎤🛡️

This project provides a machine learning-based system for detecting fraudulent audio recordings, specifically targeting audio deepfakes, using advanced deep learning techniques. Our aim is to enhance security measures against voice impersonation and manipulation in various applications.

🚀 Features

The system uses a combination of:

- Pre-trained ResNet18 model with Bi-GRU for classification
- Mel spectrograms with masking for robust feature extraction
- Advanced data augmentation techniques including time shift, noise addition, pitch shift, and gain adjustments
- A balanced dataset combining ASV Spoof 2019 and Orpheus-generated samples
- The project achieves 95-97% precision and recall in detecting fraudulent audio, making it particularly valuable for industries.
